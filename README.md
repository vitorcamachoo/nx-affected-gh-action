# action-nx-affected-apps

## Inputs

### `head`

SHA of the commit to compare **to**


### `base`

## Outputs

### `affected-apps`

a JSON-encoded array of app names which are changed between the `base` and `head` commits

### `affected-libs`

a JSON-encoded array of app names which are changed between the `base` and `head` commits


## Example

This action requires that your repo has been cloned by `actions/checkout`, and has node setup by `actions/setup-node`

```yml

  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2

        with:
          base: BASE
          head: HEAD
